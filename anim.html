                            <p> <h6>AE Collage Animation</h6>
                                My group member and I want to play with mainly collage and greenscreen. Having a collage landscape and a character moving inside a fictional environment. After disscussing the entire mood of the cilp we wnat to convey, since we have a lot of stuff going on in the collage, we came up with a detailed storyboard with the assets we want to use and transitions between scenes beforehand so that we can save time.
                            <br><br><br><br>
                            <img width="100%" src="ITP/anim/w4/Scan%2014.jpeg" >
                            <img width="100%" src="ITP/anim/w4/Scan%2015.jpeg" >
                            <img width="100%" src="ITP/anim/w4/Scan%2016.jpeg" ><br><br>
                             <br><br>
                            We split up the work into three parts and set up a moodboard so that we work with the same style. And I am incharge of the first part. Until the person starts to walk in the long landscape.
                            <br><br>
                            For this specific project, we are relying on the music very much, so as I animates the assets, I first listen to the whole track and mark the beats, climax and attributes that happened in time. <br><br><br><br>
                            <img width="100%" src="ITP/anim/w4/mark.png" ><br><br><br><br>
                            
                            The function that I like the most in AE is parenting. Most of the assets in my work perform well only if it is parent to another main body. However, for the head opening part, I figured that parent is only good for still images but not working as well for the footage. So I tried using the tracking function, but it never worked for my computer...
                            <br><br><br><br>
                            <img width="100%" src="ITP/anim/w4/track.png" ><br><br><br><br>
                            
                            Fortunatly, this zoomin & opening up part isn't long so I can just manually fix the positioning of the landscape in the brain and the opened cap. <br><br>
                            I really enjoyed making the landscape in the brain by creating a seperate composition and have muiltiple characters moving in the same frame. But the opening music isn't long enough so I can really have a long scene on this part.
                            <br><br><br><br>
                            <img width="100%" src="ITP/anim/w4/land.png" ><br><br><br><br>
                            And personally, my favorite scene that I've created is this scene of the earth in the univers with a red door sitting on it.<br><br><br><br>
                            <img width="100%" src="ITP/anim/w4/earth.png" ><br><br><br><br>
                            I think what can be improved next time is the way we work as a group. Eventhough we've talked through the storyboard many times, and looking at the mood of the collage that we want to carry together, some of us have the assigned part done the last minute and we didn't have time to go through the final piece together as a team and give each other feedback and help. Everyone had different experiences in AE, so we need to know who needs more time to figure out the time schedule and way to teach each other.

                            In the article by Kevin Kelly, talked about the two parallel world -- the real world and the digital world --  intersects, which driven by the augmented reality, as called the Mirrorworld. This article is really interesting and also he introduced a lot of existing projects. And really make me think about as a designer or artist or even just a consumer, what is the purpose of using AR and how far it can go.<br><br>
                            The concept of "two parallel world in AR" make me think about, why would people want something digital to appear on a physical real world (in a digital device)? I think it has a great opportunity to become a prototyping tool for designers to cut down wastes and budget. For example, for architect, they can adjust the design in the program, to put it at the actual space they will be building it. Also for fashion designers, before production, dripping, pattern making, fitting can all be down in AR before the real production. Even for designs that required digital printing, can be applyed directly on to it. New job opportunities will be available (to create libraries): AR civil engineerer, AR pattern maker, AR fabric/textile designer and etc. <br><br>
                            If possible, the customer end should also work like this: fitting using AR and adjust sizes in the program --> data sent to the factory --> ordermade tailoring, no premade and stock so no waste. Also as a customer, it will be a great opportunity for furniture companies to have a interior design AR app online, after the customer designed with the AR furnitures, they can order directly from the app. <br><br>

                                For this week's project, we went through a lot of ideas and stories, and had a 3 mintue long story, which is already a simplified version of the actual story and we think that it will lose its meaning if we simplify it even more, so we instead, inspired by the materials we got: some colorful wools--maybe some hair story? <br><br>
                            As we started making the characters, we build up the plot for them. I'm very into photography and always wanted to try doing some cinematography for a short story. Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZ2OY5-TeM">Toy Story 4</a> I feel like not only how the entire enviornment for the character feels real or not, but using similar cinematography that's used for actual movie/videos will also help building the characters more. Through this project, I feel strongly that this is sort of where my passion is and also my focus point when watching a anime film (other than the plot).
                            <br><br>
                            Also, we do not want to give to much identity to the characters, so we kept them without speaking any lines by only making some emotional sounds, just like Minions.
                            <br><br>

                            Even though I feel anxious when I was doing the project, but mostly enjoying it alot. The most struggling part for this project will be using Dragonframe is still kind of unfamiliar for us. We only realized (or remembered) that the 'zoom in' only works as a preview but not a crop until we export the video...

                            <h6>Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art</h6>
                                
                            This is a very interesting but at the same time a difficult comic book to me. The words are simple but the it makes me read twice in order to understand concepts. Scott Mccloud starting from definding what exactly is comic as an art form, a medium of expression an idea, the 'closure' (design kid happy to see the old friend mentioned here) happened in the gutters, the time and space and etc... We might see similar concepts in other form of arts but all of them can only happen in comics. I'm a comic person, specially I read a lot of mangas. Though, like he mentioned early in the book, there are still a lot of people think it is a "cheap, disposable, kiddie fare". But like books and movies, there are already a lot of people inspired by comics, or experienced some sort of life that they never get to experienced. There are even educational Mangas with proffessional terminology that introduced some occupation, which is not as popular, and increased the interest of public towards that occupation. This I think also proved Mcclound's point on the readers tend to put themselves in the characters.
