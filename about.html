I wanted to alert people of their lack of awareness of their surroundings.I once tested this set of playing cards on my friends. They are surprised of how they forgot simple, personal questions such as ‘grandparent’s birthday’ and are guilty and anxious of it.</p></div></div>

                                THEREFORE, ZERO</h6><p> Sustainable Branding, Lasercut on Lotus and Bamboo Leaves<br><br>Therefore, Zero has been founded as a sustainable design studio by a team of designers, who want to explore ways of creating novel package designs that are both ethically and aesthetically pleasing. The designers want to motivate the general public to live a sustainable life by experimenting with package alternatives using zero-waste materials. As an inspiration, Studio Zero showcases several experiments — like a dissolvable tea bag and a container made of Lotus leaves. <br><br>

To initiate the urgently needed discussion, studio Zero has developed a manifesto that is published on the website. It helps us reducing our waste by applying small changes of our behavior. If only a hundred people join this movement every month we will reduce the amount of waste considerably.
